lnkdump2000 - view Windows .LNK files

The released AppImages were built on Debian 11 (bullseye) and require at least Glibc 2.31 to run.

Build-depends:
- fltk 1.3

What works:
- Parsing basic structures, link header, string data -- displays target name in most cases.
- Various Shell Id types are poorly documented, but effort is made to parse common ones.

What does not work:
- Undocumented fields in shellids, PropertyStore data, BagMRU structures, most 0xBEEFxxxx
  extension blocks (only beef0004 works), subshellids.
